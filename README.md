WHEN WAS THAT

This app helps you remember the events you attended.
When you enter a new event, you select the date you attended it, and give it a rating from 1 to 10.
You can also select a category from five: film, performance, exhibition, concert or show.
Optionally, you can also add a short comment about the event.
